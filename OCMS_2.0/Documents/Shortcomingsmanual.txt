Shortcomings of OCMS are:

1. The system is not highly secure.
2. The system is not scalable. It cannot store too much of data as it has not been hosted.
3. The performance of the system is not the best.If, a different software stack would be used for exsmple MEAN stack, it would definitely improve the overall performance.
4. The website has not been hosted. Using AWS the web application must be hosted.
